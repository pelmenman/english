## task 1 ##

**copper twisted-pair cable** — медный провод витой пары

Twisted pair cabling is a type of wiring used for communications in which two conductors of a single circuit are twisted together for the purposes of improving electromagnetic compatibility. 

**fiber-optic cables** — оптоволоконный кабель

A fiber optic cable is a network cable that contains strands of glass fibers inside an insulated casing.

**coaxial cable** — коаксиальный кабель

Coaxial cable, or coax (pronounced /ˈkoʊ.æks/) is a type of electrical cable consisting of an inner conductor surrounded by a concentric conducting shield, with the two separated by a dielectric

**Digital Subscriber Line** — цифровая абонентская линия

DSL is a family of technologies that are used to transmit digital data over telephone lines.

**dial-up connection** — модемное соединение

Dial-up connection is a connection between two devices using standard telephone service

**bandwidth** — пропускная способность

The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time.

**broadband access** — широкополосный доступ 

In telecommunications, broadband is the wide-bandwidth data transmission that transports multiple signals at a wide range of frequencies and Internet traffic types, which enables messages to be sent simultaneously and is used in fast internet connections. 

**to broadcast** — транслировать

to send out a programme on television or radio

**attenuation of a signal** — ослабевание/затухание (??) сигнала

the process of making signal weaker

**cell sites** — ретрансляционная станция станция мобильной связи?

cell sites the entire set of equipment needed to receive and transmit radio signals for cellular voice and data transmission

**radio frequencies** — частота радиоволн

Radio frequency is the number of electromagnetic waves in one second

**power-line Internet** — интернет по линии электропередачи?

internet connected by a thick wire that carries electricity

**to surf the Net** — сидеть в интернете

to look at information on the Internet by moving from one page to another using electronic links

**transceiver** — приемопередатчик 

a transceiver is an electronic device which is a combination of a radio transmitter and a receiver

**Internet Protocol Suite** — набор интернет протоколов?

Internet Protocol suite (IP suite) is the standard network model and communication protocol stack used on the Internet...

**hypertext-based system** — система основанная на гипертексте 

Hypertext-based systems are computer systems used to create and maintain hypertext databases and provide mechanisms for users to access the information

**terrestrial access** — наземный доступ

type of internet access by using terrestrial transmitter? 

**Satellite Internet access** — доступ к спутниковому интернету

Satellite Internet access is Internet access provided through communication satellites.

**cellular network** — сотовая — сеть 

A cellular network is a radio network spread out over land in the form of cells, each of which has a base station permanently installed

## task 2 ## 
1. What does ADSL stand for? Why is this type of connection called
asymmetric?

ADSL stands for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line. It is asymmetric because the download speed is faster than upload speed.

2. What is the difference between a dial-up connection and DSL?

Dial-up: only one service can be provided at a time
and it is impossible to use the phone to make calls and browse the Internet at the same time.

DSL: utilizes the standard telephone lines, but allows digital signals to
be carried rather than analogue

3. What is the origin of the term ‘dial-up connection’?

A dial-up connection to the Internet is set up by dialing a phone number, hence the
name.

4. What is the downside of cable Internet?

the speed can be slower during peak usage hours when a lot of Internet users are online.

5. What types of wireless Internet connections are mentioned in the text?

Wi-Fi, cellular and satellite Internet

6. How is data transferred over fiber-optic cables?

Those cables send data to and from a computer by harnessing the power of light and can carry data over long distances with low attenuation and distortion of the light signal

7. What equipment does one need to get access to the Internet through
satellite systems?

To get access to the Internet, one needs a satellite dish for two-way (upload and download) data communications and a modem.
