Task 4. Choose the correct word from the text to complete the sentences.

1. Packet switching is the primary basis for data communications in computer **network** worldwide.
2. Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching with the goal to provide **fault-tolerant, efficient** routing method for telecommunication messages.
3. Davies is credited with coining the modern term **packet switching**.
4. Packets are received, buffered, queued and **retransmitted**.
5. Circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of **connection time**.

Task 5. Scan the text to mark the statements below true or false.

1. In the early 1970s, American computer scientist Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching.  **FALSE: in the early 1960s**
2. Packet switching allows delivery of variable bit rate data streams, realized as sequences of packets. **True**
3. Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering. **True**
4. Packets can not be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing, traffic shaping, or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service. **FALSE: they can**
5. Packet-based communication may be implemented with or without intermediate forwarding nodes (switches and routers). **True**
